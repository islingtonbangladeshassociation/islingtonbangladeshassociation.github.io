<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Physical & Mental wellbeing Project</h2>


<p>We have established long-term partnerships with a range of agencies to offer events and workshops aimed at supporting the physical and mental health of our participants. These collaborations enable us to connect local experts and researchers with our community, providing valuable insights that empower members to make informed decisions about their health and adopt lifestyle changes that enhance their well-being and overall quality of life. Through these initiatives, we address health inequalities that were highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project also includes counselling services in participants' mother tongues, ensuring those who face language barriers can access the support they need. Additionally, we offer training on managing long-term health conditions, helping individuals take proactive steps in maintaining their health.</p>
