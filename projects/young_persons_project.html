<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Young Person’s Project</h2>


<p>The project offers three dynamic clubs designed to support and empower young people in various aspects of their personal development.
    The Literacy Club focuses on developing young people’s reading and writing skills, encouraging a lifelong passion for books and literature. Through engaging activities, the club aims to foster literacy in a fun and accessible way.
    The Health Club provides practical learning experiences that equip young participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The club covers topics ranging from nutrition to exercise, promoting sickness-free living.
    The Life Skills Club, held every Wednesday from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm, helps young people build essential life skills while boosting their confidence. It fosters good citizenship and actively discourages negative behaviours such as antisocial actions, drug use, and youth disorder. This club is designed to promote personal responsibility and positive choices, encouraging young people to thrive in their communities.</p>
