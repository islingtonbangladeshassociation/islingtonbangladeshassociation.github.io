<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">You Are Not Alone Project</h2>


<p>This five-year initiative, funded by the National Lottery’s Reaching Communities Fund, runs from September 2019 to December 2024. The project is dedicated to providing targeted support to minority ethnic and refugee women, with a focus on those who have experienced domestic violence—especially women who have entered the UK through marriage to British nationals. It also supports women aged 30-50 facing challenging home environments, mental health struggles, and lone parents with young children lacking family support.
    In response to the rising incidence of domestic violence, the project offers a range of activities to address isolation, including exercise classes, health awareness workshops, a luncheon club, advice on income maximisation, and outdoor activities. Serving some of Islington's most disadvantaged communities, many of these women face financial insecurity, inadequate housing, and limited access to services.
    By providing holistic support, the project empowers women, enhances their well-being, and strengthens community connections, while working to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and domestic violence within minority ethnic groups. The initiative is making a profound, positive impact on the lives of its participants.</p>
